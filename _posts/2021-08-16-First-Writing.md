## Finally I could write...

I could finally start writing. I have so many plans and deadlines to meet. I have got 4 assignments submission in the next two weeks! I want to teach Simmy operating system. I want to start writing blogs. I want to broadcast my skills to the world (I guess I have those necessary skills :D). There are so many things I want to discover too.

Almost every day just goes by thinking about how I see myself in the future. I listen to some badass music :p and act/dance how I&apos;m gonna celebrate when I achieve my goals. Or I plan on how or when I&apos;m gonna do something contributing to my long-term goal (planning yes, a lot of planning actually! but acting on it...hmm :p)-I call this the **knowledge trap**. I have so much work I want to achieve.

Finally, I could write. This is the first step. I am just writing down what is flowing in my head else I&apos;ll fall into the knowledge trap (this term is catchy, eh? :p). So forget organization for the first time writing! Forget about the fear to write! Hopefully, by today itself I get the courage to learn how to post this blog.

To be honest, I think the ultimate goal I want to achieve is to always see happiness in the eyes of the people I love and respect. My grandparents,my parents, my brother, some cousins :p, a handful of really close friends and some members of my family that I might be forgetting :D Homage to my late friend Woozy <3  Now one chief thing that you need to know is that I am in love. Not expecting this sentence? Hehehe I am writing with the flow.

> Remember: Let us not fall into the knowledge trap :)

Speaking from my heart, she drives me. I think about her a lot. She is beautiful! She is smart! I call her Babe. My bed routine every night for 1 year now, has been to hug my pillow thinking about her even though we were meeting :D. If you still remember Simmy from the first paragraph, she is the sister of my Babe. Finally, God gave me a little sister ;)

Yes! Achieving my goals will give me more strength to talk to my Babe&apos;s parents and my parents too. With the permission and love from my Babe, of course, I want to unite our two families. I want neither me nor Babe to have in-laws that only know you for your skills to prepare and serve tea, your skills to repair printers... No! I want my-laws to treat me like their eldest son or friend or bro, you know. Laughing with Babe and family over a glass of rum (with a few more :p) and little sister is sipping on her red bull (Not yet the legal age. See! Very responsible :p) This is what I call- **Pure Genuine Happiness**. Likewise for my Babe with my family <3 So what love? How love? Where love?

I want to be able to (or at least be dedicating my time to):
Impress my family. Impress my Babe and her family. Gain knowledge.

> My journey for love = My journey for Success

To achieve Pure Genuine Happiness, I am embarking on a journey to:
- At least set up an online company that provides Artificial Intelligence solutions for fashion, sports, engineering, education, and so on
- Write blogs about my journey to success
- Write technical blogs about things I know and learning too
- Work with my friend Robert on a social media app
- Be open to the opportunity to become a co-founder (of course right? :D)
- Help little sister with her exams
- Complete my studies :p (Yeah! Still studying Artificial Intelligence at masters level)


Finally, I started working on my dreams...
