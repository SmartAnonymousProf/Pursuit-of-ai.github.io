<p>I could finally start writing. I have so many plans and deadlines to meet. I have got 4 assignments submission in the next two weeks! I want to teach Simmy operating system. I want to start writing blogs. I want to broadcast my skills to the world (I guess I have those necessary skills :D). There are so many things I want to discover too.</p>

<p>Almost every day just goes by thinking about how I see myself in the future. I listen to some badass music :p and act/dance how I'm gonna celebrate when I achieve my goals. Or I plan on how or when I'm gonna do something contributing to my long-term goal (planning yes, a lot of planning actually! but acting on it…hmm :p)-I call this the <strong>knowledge trap</strong>. I have so much work I want to achieve.</p>

<p>Finally, I could write. This is the first step. I am just writing down what is flowing in my head else I'll fall into the knowledge trap (this term is catchy, eh? :p). So forget organization for the first time writing! Forget about the fear to write! Hopefully, by today itself I get the courage to learn how to post this blog.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think the ultimate goal I want to achieve is to always see happiness in the eyes of the people I love and respect. My grandparents,my parents, my brother, some cousins :p, a handful of really close friends and some members of my family that I might be forgetting :D Homage to my late friend Woozy &lt;3  Now one chief thing that you need to know is that I am in love. Not expecting this sentence? Hehehe I am writing with the flow.</p>

  <p>Remember: Let us not fall into the knowledge trap :)</p>

Speaking from my heart, she drives me. I think about her a lot. She is beautiful! She is smart! I call her Babe. My bed routine every night for 1 year now, has been to hug my pillow thinking about her even though we were meeting :D. If you still remember Simmy from the first paragraph, she is the sister of my Babe. Finally, God gave me a little sister ;)
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>

<p>Yes! Achieving my goals will give me more strength to talk to my Babe's parents and my parents too. With the permission and love from my Babe, of course, I want to unite our two families. I want neither me nor Babe to have in-laws that only know you for your skills to prepare and serve tea, your skills to repair printers… No! I want my-laws to treat me like their eldest son or friend or bro, you know. Laughing with Babe and family over a glass of rum (with a few more :p) and little sister is sipping on her red bull (Not yet the legal age. See! Very responsible :p) This is what I call- <strong>Pure Genuine Happiness</strong>. Likewise for my Babe with my family &lt;3</p>

<p>So what love? How love? Where love?</p>

<p>I want to be able to (or at least be dedicating my time to):
Impress my family. Impress my Babe and her family. Gain knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My journey for love = My journey for Success</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To achieve Pure Genuine Happiness, I am embarking on a journey to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>At least set up an online company that provides Artificial Intelligence solutions for fashion, sports, engineering, education, and so on</li>
  <li>Write blogs about my journey to success</li>
  <li>Write technical blogs about things I know and learning too</li>
  <li>Work with my friend Robert on a social media app</li>
  <li>Be open to the opportunity to become a co-founder (of course right? :D)</li>
  <li>Help little sister with her exams</li>
  <li>Complete my studies :p (Yeah! Still studying Artificial Intelligence at masters level)</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I started working on my dreams…</p>
